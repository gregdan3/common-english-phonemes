# common phonemes
Collects the most frequently used phonemes in all documented English dialects
on [Phoible](https://phoible.org/).

## Setup
`make init` or `pdm install`

## Use
`make run` or `pdm run python ./pronouner.py`

## Why?
I wanted to pick up linguistics knowledge, and decided a fun side project to do
that would be to design and propose a singular, genderless, third person pronoun
to replace the use of singular "they" in English.

This script was the starting point: what phonemes are even reasonable to use? My
answer was to start from the most common phonemes in all documented English
dialects.
